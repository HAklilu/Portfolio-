Portfolio final grade: 86

Comments:  I like that you took extra time to think about the images on other pages.  Your final version actually works well as a mobile site, but not quite so well as a standard website.  Also you could have used a bit more attention to the little details in your code. A good solid effort, and it could be cleaned up without very much effort.
