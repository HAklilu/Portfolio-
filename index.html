    <p id="stunt"> As you now from the header my name is Himma. So lets talk a bit about me and my background! I attend The Peddie School, which is a boarding
        school, in Hightstown, New Jersey </p>
        
    <p> I love engineering. I started a robotics team in middle school and continued my
        love since. A little insert is that my favorite color is orange. Along with participating in robotics I play field
        hockey and lacrosse. </p>
